/* addrs.h — every ROM and system address this recreate names, in one place.
 *
 * THE SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH ACROSS THE LANGUAGE BOUNDARY. The C cores include this; the Python
 * side (`test/`, `tools/boot_snapshot.py`) reads the same `#define`s out of this file through
 * `tools/addrs.py`, which parses it. Neither side keeps a second copy, so an address cannot be
 * right in the reconstruction and wrong in the case that proves it.
 *
 * Addresses here are the machine's own — a ROM address is where the ROM is mapped ($FC0000), and a
 * system-variable address is where TOS itself puts it. They are therefore also Ghidra addresses for
 * this project, whose image is loaded at its real base with no relocation (see ../README.md).
